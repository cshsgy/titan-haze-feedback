# Step 3 — Coupling scope: Step 2 haze → Fortran RT

How to drive the Step 1 engine (`src/example_bowen_fort/`) with the Step 2
microphysics haze, and iterate the two to a self-consistent fixed point.

## Architecture: Python orchestration, file-based coupling

The Fortran reads its haze once at init from the **prescribed-haze path**
(`haze_data='presc'`), so we couple **without touching the Fortran source**: a
Python loop regenerates the prescribed-haze files from the microphysics each
outer iteration and re-runs the model.

```
T0  (guess, e.g. titan_reference)
repeat:
    atm   = Atmosphere.from_profile(z, T)         # T from the Fortran (or T0 on iter 0)
    micro = solve_bvp_profile(atm)                # Step 2 -> n(z), Nbar(z), ...
    write_presc_haze(micro, atm)                  # -> coupledhaze{v,i}_{tau,g,ssa}.txt
    run_fortran(seed_T=T)                          # Step 1 -> new T(z), P(z)
    T = read_fortran_T()
until  max|ΔT| < tol
```

The microphysics rates depend on T (`β ∝ T/η(T)`, settling, free-molecular
`T^{1/2}`), so this is a genuine feedback fixed point, not a one-shot.

## The interface the Fortran expects

`haze_init` → `read_presc` reads, per band `v` (shortwave) and `i` (longwave),
three files `INPUT/DATA/<haze_presc_file><band>_<field>.txt` with
`field ∈ {tau, g, ssa}`. Format (see `preschazev_tau.txt`):

```
<header line>
<nwn>                      # 43 for v, 41 for i
<npl>                      # 600
<wn[1..nwn]>               # wavenumbers [cm^-1]
<pl[1..npl]>               # pressures [Pa], ascending (0.0177 .. 1.46e5)
<row 1: nwn values @ pl[1]>
...
<row npl: nwn values @ pl[npl]>
```

- **`tau`** = *cumulative* haze optical depth, top-down (the Fortran differences
  it to per-layer `dtau`). **`ssa`, `g`** = *local* values at each `(pl, wn)`.
- The grid is independent of the model layers — the Fortran bilinearly
  interpolates `(log p, wn)` onto its own `wnov/wnoi × plev`. **Reuse the existing
  `pl` grid and `wn` grids verbatim** so the interpolation behaves identically.
- LW haze is a pure absorber: write `ssa=0, g=0` for band `i`.

Set `haze_presc_file = 'coupledhaze'` in the namelist so we write
`coupledhaze*.txt` and leave the observational `preschaze*.txt` untouched.

## What we already have (reuse)

| need | exists as |
|---|---|
| Atmosphere from arbitrary `T(z)` | `Atmosphere.from_profile(z, T, P_surf)` |
| microphysics haze profile | `solve_bvp_profile(atm) -> BVPResult(z, n, Nbar, rho_h, r, r_a, omega)` |
| per-band haze τ from microphysics (RDG) | `aggregate_optics.aggregate_haze_layer_tau(column, micro, wn_cm, omega0_band, d_mono, pure_absorber)` |
| spectral ω₀(λ), g(λ) | `optics.spectral_haze_sw(...)` (observational; composition-only, amount set by microphysics) |
| monomer radius `d` | `microphysics.constants.AerosolParams.d_mono` (50 nm) |
| read the Fortran T snapshot | `compare_fortran.load_fortran` / `rt_diagnostics.fortran_state` (last finite snapshot) |

So the haze **amount** (τ) comes from the microphysics RDG cross-section × `n·Nbar`;
the **scattering** (ω₀, g) stays the observational spectral shape — exactly the
mapping our DISORT coupled run already uses.

## New code (small)

1. **`src/coupling/presc_haze.py`** — `write_presc_haze(micro, atm, out_dir, name='coupledhaze')`:
   - reuse the existing `wn` grids (43 SW / 41 LW) and `pl` grid (600) read from
     the observational files;
   - build a `Column` on `pl` (hydrostatic z from `atm`);
   - SW: `aggregate_haze_layer_tau(col, micro, wn_v, omega0_v, d_mono)` + `spectral_haze_sw` → τ, ssa, g;
   - LW: `aggregate_haze_layer_tau(col, micro, wn_i, None, d_mono, pure_absorber=True)`, ssa=g=0;
   - cumulate τ top-down; write the 6 files in the exact format.
2. **`scripts/run_coupled.py`** — the outer loop above; under-relax `T` between
   iterations; log `max|ΔT|` and the stratopause; save the fixed-point profile +
   a convergence plot.
3. **`scripts/run_fortran.sh`** tweak (or `run_fortran_coupled.sh`) — seed
   `initial_temperatures.txt` from the previous iteration's T (`init_t=1`) for a
   warm start, and optionally a smaller `num_i` once warm.
4. **namelist**: `haze_presc_file='coupledhaze'`, `init_t=1` (warm start).

## Validation ladder

1. **Round-trip** — DONE. `coupling.presc_haze.write_presc_haze` writes the
   prescribed-haze tables; `tests/test_presc_haze.py` (33 checks) validates the
   format, and `scripts/roundtrip_haze.py` feeds the *observational* haze back
   through the writer → Fortran → reproduces the stock `preschaze` `T(z)` to
   **0.000 K**. Writer + format validated against the real reader.
2. **One-shot** — DONE. `coupling.microphysics_haze(micro, atm)` maps the Step 2
   profile to the tables (RDG τ from `n·N̄` on the SW/LW wn grids, cumulated;
   ω₀/g keep the observational spectral shape; LW pure absorber) and reproduces
   the DISORT coupled run's haze τ to `rtol=1e-9` (`tests/test_presc_haze.py`).
   `scripts/oneshot_haze.py` drives BOTH engines with that haze: DISORT
   stratopause 142 K, Fortran 131 K (tropopause 72 K both); max |ΔT| 15.5 K in
   the lower stratosphere — the RT-engine difference (8-stream vs two-stream) +
   the Fortran's residual top oscillation, not a coupling error. The wiring
   delivers the intended optics.
3. **Iterate** — DONE (`scripts/run_coupled.py`). Closes the loop: prescribed-haze
   baseline, then `Fortran T → Atmosphere.from_profile → solve_bvp_profile →
   microphysics_haze → rewrite tables → cold-start re-run`, under-relaxed, with a
   feedback report + `writing/figs/coupled_feedback.png` + `docs/coupled_history.txt`.
   Each pass cold-starts (full equilibration) so the residual reflects the
   feedback, not a half-relaxed engine (an early warm-start version with reduced
   `num_i` falsely "converged" at the baseline).

## Step 3 result: a strong, near-bistable feedback

The coupled iteration does **not** settle to a single fixed point under naive
under-relaxation. It oscillates between two attractors:

- **warm**: stratopause $\sim\!183\,\mathrm{K}$ at $8\,\mathrm{Pa}$ (close to the
  prescribed-haze baseline, $184.5\,\mathrm{K}$);
- **cool**: stratopause $\sim\!131$–$135\,\mathrm{K}$ at $1.3$–$1.7\,\mathrm{Pa}$
  (the microphysics-haze state; matches the one-shot's $131\,\mathrm{K}$).

They are **anti-correlated** — a warm $T$ makes a haze that radiates to a cool
equilibrium and vice-versa, i.e. period-2 oscillation. With `relax=0.5` the loop
damped toward $\sim\!133\,\mathrm{K}$ (iters 2–5, `max|dT|` $60\to6\,\mathrm{K}$)
but then jumped back to the warm state — a near-discontinuity around
$T\approx137\,\mathrm{K}$ (a $1.3\,\mathrm{K}$ input change flipped the output
$48\,\mathrm{K}$). So the radiative$\leftrightarrow$microphysical feedback is
**strong and destabilising** (the stratopause-warming haze feedback has gain
$>1$ near the cool branch), with a sharp transition between branches.

**Implication / next steps.** A converged fixed point needs (a) harder damping
(`relax<=0.25`, now the default) and more iterations, and/or (b) a continuation /
root-finding method (e.g. solve $T = F(\mathrm{haze}(T))$ with a damped Newton or
bisection on a scalar feedback parameter) rather than fixed-point iteration. The
two-branch structure is itself the headline Step-3 finding: Titan's haze feedback
is strong enough to be bistable in this 1-D coupled model. Whether the cool
branch is physical or an artifact of the sharp microphysics transition at
$\sim\!137\,\mathrm{K}$ is the question to resolve next (inspect `n*Nbar` and the
column $\tau$ across the transition).

## Risks / decisions to make

1. **Unconverged Fortran top — RESOLVED.** The haze source sits at ~1 Pa, where
   the Fortran used to oscillate by ~24 K. Fixed via option (a): a **per-layer
   step cap** (`dT_cap=1.0 K` in `run_planetary_radiation.F90`) bounds the top
   oscillation to ~2.5 K @1 Pa with the converged profile unchanged (see
   `docs/rt_discrepancies.md`). The coupled feedback at the haze source is now on
   stable ground; the residual ~2.5 K is averaged out by the last-20-snapshot
   mean.
2. **Cost.** Each outer iteration is a full Fortran run (num_i steps). Warm-start
   from the previous T and cut `num_i` once warm; expect a handful of outer
   iterations.
3. **Fixed-point stability.** Under-relax `T` (and/or the haze τ) between
   iterations; the τ ∝ 1/(1−ω₀) amplification can overshoot.
4. **z↔P consistency.** Use the Fortran's hydrostatic z (or `atm`'s) consistently
   when mapping microphysics(z) onto the `pl` grid.

## Effort

- Writer + round-trip test: small (reuses existing optics).
- Orchestration + warm-start: small–moderate.
- Fixed-point stability + the unconverged top: the real work.
